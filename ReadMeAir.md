### Airline Passenger Satisfaction Rates

This project is to better my skills in Machine Learing and using Streamlit. Using the data set given to us, airline_passenger_satisfaction, the idea was to figure out what features would and would not make these massengers happy depending on the feature ratings. We have explored data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple classification algorithms to identify the key factors influencing customer satisfaction. In the end, it was my goal to create an app that accurately portrayed what would and would not satisfy a passenger for their airplane travel. 

##### Dataset overview
